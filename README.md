Cryptmon
========

A basic CLI app (for Linux and Mac currently, although other platforms might work) for displaying the price of Cryptocurrency coins.

Partly as a custom tool to scratch an itch, but also as a new project with which to learn and experiment with the Rust programming language, as well as various HTTP/Web APIs for access to Crypto prices, and to learn a bit more about Crypto
exchanges and price tracking.

Possible Future Work
--------------------

* More price providers
* A GUI?
* Price Alert functionality
